To use these files:
1) Create a directory under the ARCGis Pro project called 'scripts' and place
    these files in that directory.
2) Edit the main.py file to load the rasters you would like to analyze
    and set the coordinates of the point of flow that you would like to use.
3) Open the ARCGis Pro python console, right-click to show the menu and use
    the 'load code' option and load the 'main.py' file. It should load the
    others if needed. Press enter. The script should run and load the results
    into the current map.

The data used in the example is from
